# Reliable IoT Data Collection with FreeRTOS on Xiao ESP32S3

## Project Description
This project implements a resilient IoT system using FreeRTOS on the XIAO ESP32S3, ensuring continuous sensor data collection and seamless cloud synchronization. The system is designed to maintain data integrity even during network outages, making it ideal for applications requiring reliable long-term data collection in potentially unstable network environments.

## Key Features
- Continuous sensor data collection
- Local data storage during network outages
- Automatic data synchronization with cloud when connection is restored
- Power-efficient operation for extended battery life
- Over-the-Air (OTA) update capability
- Robust error handling and logging

## Hardware Requirements
- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 board
- Sensors (specifics depend on your application)
- Optional: SD card for extended local storage

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- FreeRTOS (comes with ESP32 core)
- ESP32 board support package
- Required libraries (WiFi, SPIFFS, etc.)

## System Architecture

### FreeRTOS Tasks
1. **WiFi Management Task**: Monitors and maintains WiFi connection
2. **Sensor Data Collection Task**: Continuously collects data from sensors
3. **Data Storage Task**: Manages local data storage
4. **Data Transmission Task**: Handles cloud synchronization

### Data Flow
1. Sensor data is continuously collected
2. Data is temporarily stored in RAM
3. If WiFi is available, data is immediately sent to the cloud
4. If WiFi is unavailable, data is stored locally (SPIFFS or SD card)
5. When WiFi connection is restored, stored data is synchronized with the cloud

## Setup and Configuration

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect sensors to XIAO ESP32S3 (provide pin connections)
2. (Optional) Connect SD card module

### Software Setup
1. Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
2. Install ESP32 board support package
3. Install required libraries
4. Configure WiFi credentials and cloud endpoint in `config.h`

## Usage
1. Upload the code to your XIAO ESP32S3
2. The system will automatically start collecting data and attempting to connect to WiFi
3. Monitor the serial output for system status and debugging information

## Power Management
- Implement deep sleep modes between sensor readings
- Use ESP32's ULP (Ultra Low Power) coprocessor for periodic wake-ups

## Security Considerations
- Secure WiFi connection using WPA2
- Implement TLS/SSL for secure data transmission to the cloud
- Use secure storage for sensitive configuration data

## Future Enhancements
- Implement data compression to optimize storage and transmission
- Add support for multiple sensor types
- Develop a web interface for real-time data visualization
- Implement machine learning for predictive maintenance or anomaly detection

## Troubleshooting
- Check serial output for error messages and system status
- Verify WiFi credentials and network stability
- Ensure sufficient power supply
